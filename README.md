Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software Engineering is a field of computer science that deals with development of software with specific goal through the SDLC.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. planing and analysis
2. development and testing
3. deployment and maintainance

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement gathering and analysis - involve gathering the specific reqirements of the software to build.
2. Planning and design - involve breaking down tasks, giving timeline, choose architecture/technologies and some aspect of design according to the specification.
3. Development - involves writing code/development of the software with the given technologies and architecture.
4. Testing - involves testing the code to make sure of its quality, alignment with behavior etc. There are different kinds of testing including unit, integration, system and acceptance.
5. Deployment - involves making the developed and tested code available for use, also refered to as running it on the production enviroment or server.
6. Maintainance - involves fixing bugs, migrating databases .. overall maintaing the software to make sure it keep working as desired.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall methodology focus more on process rather than product, and takes a long time in the mentioned phases which makes it unsuccessful to use for projects with a fast paced changes in the given requirements.
- Agile is a more recent methodology and it based on the agile manifesto which basis its ideology by aligning its values as indivisuals and interactions over procecess and tools, working software over comperhensive documentation, customer colllaboration over contract negotiaton, responding to change over following a plan.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer have the role and respnsibility of developing the given system with the chosen technologies and according to the requrement
- Quality Assurance Engineer have the role and resposibility to testing the quality, and acceptability of the system based on the requirement.
- Project manager have the role and responsibility of managing to resources to meet the given schedule, quality and with in budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDE's are special kinds of software designed to aid the process of development, by integrating, editors, linters, terminal etc. examples include visual studio, Intelij, pycharm, netbeans etc
- VCS's are other important softwares and systems used to keep track of project over time for seemless collaboration, management and rollback of codebase. examples include git, Mercurial etc

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- bugs in code - using debuggers, googling errors
- interacting with legacy system - by reading the given docoumentation, comperhencive research

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- unit testing concentrates on make sure parts of code(eg function/method) work well as a unit, for example with different types of inputs ..
- integration testing focus on making sure systems are integrated proprely and behaving as expected. eg frontend with backend api, backend with ORM, ORM with database

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- prompt engineeting is the process of crafting clear instrucions using natual language for LLMs or GenAIs to get desired output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- tell me about testing
- act as a professional developer with strong knowledge of explining computer science concepts clearly and prepare a structured note on the topic of testing in software development in a table format with the types as column header, and in first row brief defination, second row, explanation like i'm a 15 year old, third row real world use cases. in a formal, professional and polite tone.
